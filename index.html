                  <p>"Boids" stands for bird-oid objects and was created by computer scientist <span
                              class="highlight-text">Craig Reynolds in 1986</span>.
                        It’s a simple yet powerful algorithm that simulates the collective movement of a group. Each
                        boid (a bird-like agent) follows <span class="highlight-text">three simple rules</span> to

                  <p>Boids simulate the movement of flocks, schools, and crowds using just three simple rules:
                        Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion.

                              <p>Each boid attempts to avoid running into other boids. If two or more boids get too
                                    close to one another (i.e. within one another's protected range), they will steer
                                    away from one another.</p>

                              understand, getting them to work smoothly with bigger flocks was tough. Each boid has to
                              interact with its neighbors, which takes a lot of computing power. To keep everything
                              running smoothly in real-time, I needed to use something like Quad Trees or Spatial
                              Partitioning. While Quad Trees are complicated to code, I decided to go with Spatial
                              Hashing, and it worked great!</p>

                        <p class="challenge-description">Creating a color density view meant I had to change the colors
                              of the boids based on their neighbors and how tightly they were packed together. Finding
                              the right balance between looking good and keeping things running smoothly was tricky.
                              Frequent updates could slow things down, especially when there were a lot of boids.</p>

                              be more time consuming than I thought. Even small changes to these settings led to big
                              differences in how the boids behaved. This meant I had to carefully adjust and test things
                              over and over to get it just right.</p>

                        <p class="challenge-description">I really struggled with this for a day or two. Adding visual
                              trails for each boid made the simulation look nicer, but it was tough to get the rendering
                              to work smoothly. The trails had to be long enough to show movement without cluttering the
                              display, which meant I had to optimize things carefully to keep performance from dropping.

                              forming, or how big the cluster should be. Detecting and visualizing clusters of boids in
                              real-time required algorithms that could quickly identify groups. It was really
                              unintuitive to determine what counted as a cluster and how to handle the size of those
                              clusters without hurting performance.

                              simulation to crash. This meant I had to create a strong design that could handle changes
                              smoothly and efficiently.</p>

                        the simulation to create a more dynamic environment where boids must evade threats.</p>

                        detection and avoidance system will be added to enhance the realism of the simulation, allowing
                        boids to navigate around barriers.</p>
